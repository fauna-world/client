# Fauna server

## Prerequisites

* `node` version 12 or greater
* `redis` server

## Installation

Simply run `npm install` in this directory

## Running

> `npm start`

The environment variable `FAUNA_ENV` dictates the postfix used for all keys in redis: e.g. when set to `prod` (the default), redis keys will be prefixed by `fauna-prod`. This can be set in the `start` CLI invocation like so:

> `FAUNA_ENV='dev' npm start`
